# IMDM290 - Soundscape

## Project Description
  Soundscape (Therapy) is an interactive audio-focused application that aims to adapt to users' emotional states. The application guides users through a series of reflective questions about their current feelings and mental state, then generates a personalized auditory & visual soundscape based on their responses.

## Key Features
- EEG Integration: (WIP)
- Dynamic Visuals: (WIP)
- Guided Questions: Users progress through a series of prompts and questions about their current emotional state, responding on a scale of 1-10.
- Adaptive Audio: The system activates different audio elements based on user responses, with five intensity levels (super low, low, mid, high, super high) for each emotional dimension.
- Unique Sound Environment: Multiple audio layers combine to create a unique soundscape tailored to the user's emotional profile.
